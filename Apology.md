Dear HackVenture Organisers,

I am writing to apologize for the network error issues that occurred while uploading our repository to Github. Unfortunately, during the upload process, our files got deleted due to the error. This was an unforeseen and unfortunate event, and we are truly sorry for it.

We immediately took action to recover the lost files from Github, but it took some time to complete the recovery process. We understand the importance of the files and the work that went into creating them, which is why we did everything possible to recover them as quickly as we could.

In the meantime, we have created a new branch called "my_branch," which contains the actual code that we created during the hackathon. We invite you to take a look at this branch and review the code that we have created.

We understand that the hackathon has already ended and this is not the time to commit the changes . But we request you to have a look at the code as we have made this project wholeheartedly . We hope that you accept our apologies.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Team Web Maniacs
